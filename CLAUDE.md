# CLAUDE.md

## Meta -- How to treat this file

This file is a living document. It contains rules, gotchas, and stack decisions accumulated across many projects and real production failures.

When you read this file and encounter anything that is:
- Outdated or contradicted by current library versions
- Incorrect based on what you observe in the actual project
- Missing something important you discovered during your work
- Ambiguous or unclear

**You are expected to propose an update.** At the end of your work session, if you found anything worth changing, output a clearly marked section:

```
## Suggested CLAUDE.md Updates

### [Section name]
**Reason**: what you found / why this is wrong or missing
**Proposed change**: the exact text to add, remove, or replace
```

Do not silently work around wrong guidance. Surface it so the next agent starts with better information.

## Before Starting Any Task

Before writing any code or installing any package, always fetch the latest versions:

**Never assume a version from training data — always look it up first.**

Package versions change constantly. Your training data is outdated. When in doubt:
1. Run `bun info <pkg> version` to get the current latest
2. Use `latest` tag only if no specific version is needed
3. Check the package's GitHub releases or changelog if behavior seems off

This applies especially to:
- `@tanstack/react-start`, `@tanstack/react-router` — release frequently
- `better-auth` — actively developed, breaking changes possible
- `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit` — v1 beta, changes often
- `@orpc/server`, `@orpc/client` — newer library, evolving fast
- `valibot` — v1 stable but check for updates

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following stack. Always use these tools — never substitute with alternatives unless explicitly instructed.

### Frontend & Framework
- **Framework**: TanStack Start (RC, Vite-based) + TanStack Router (file-based routing)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query v5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Forms**: TanStack Form

### Backend
- **API**: oRPC v1 (type-safe RPC + built-in OpenAPI)
- **Auth**: better-auth (with `tanstackStartCookies` plugin)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (v1 beta)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Railway)

### Runtime & Tooling
- **Runtime**: Bun (>=1.0)
- **Package Manager**: Bun (no pnpm, no npm, no yarn)
- **Validation**: Valibot (via Drizzle's built-in schema generation)
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: Railway via Dockerfile

---

## Never Use

Do not use these under any circumstances:
- `prisma` → use Drizzle ORM
- `express` / `fastify` / `nestjs` → use oRPC server routes
- `axios` → use native `fetch`
- `next.js` → use TanStack Start
- `next-auth` / `auth.js` → use better-auth
- `zod` → use Valibot
- `npm` / `yarn` / `pnpm` → use Bun
- `redux` / `zustand` / `jotai` → use TanStack Store or TanStack Query
- `styled-components` / `emotion` / `css modules` → use Tailwind CSS v4
- `react-hook-form` → use TanStack Form
- `app.config.ts` → this is the OLD Vinxi-era config, use `vite.config.ts` instead

---

## Project Structure

---

## Config Files

### vite.config.ts (correct, current setup)

### tsconfig.json (required settings)

> Do NOT enable `verbatimModuleSyntax` — causes server bundle to leak into client bundle.

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. Server/Client Boundary — MOST IMPORTANT

**Drizzle, better-auth server config, and all DB code must NEVER run on the client.**

- All server-only files go in `src/server/` or end with `.server.ts`
- Never import `drizzle-orm`, `pg`, `postgres`, or `better-auth` server config in components
- Use `vite-env-only` to enforce this at build time:

### 2. TanStack Start — Route Structure

Every route file exports a `Route` via `createFileRoute`:

The `__root.tsx` must include `HeadContent` and `Scripts`:

`routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated — never edit it manually.

### 3. oRPC Setup

Mount handler via TanStack Start Server Route:

Isomorphic client (works in both SSR and browser):

Define procedures with Valibot:

### 4. Drizzle + Valibot

Drizzle generates Valibot schemas natively — never write them manually:

Drizzle client using postgres Pool (correct for Railway):

### 5. better-auth Setup

**Critical**: always add `tanstackStartCookies()` as the LAST plugin — required for cookie handling in TanStack Start:

Mount handler:

Generate schema after configuring auth (run once):

Browser client:

### 6. Auth in oRPC — Always Protect Server-Side

Never rely on route-level guards alone — every protected oRPC procedure must check auth directly:

---

## Dockerfile (Bun + Railway)

Multi-stage build is required. The runtime stage must always include `node_modules` -- never rely on Bun auto-install in production. Bun auto-install does not resolve peer/optional-peer dependencies correctly (e.g. `kysely` from `@better-auth/kysely-adapter`, `better-call` from `@better-auth/core`).

Required stages:
1. `builder` -- install all deps + build
2. `prod-deps` -- install production-only deps (`bun install --production`)
3. `runner` -- copy `.output/` and `node_modules` from prod-deps stage

---

## Migrations

Always use Drizzle Kit — never modify the database directly or push schema to production:

`drizzle.config.ts`:

---

## Environment Variables

### Railway Postgres (auto-injected when Postgres service is connected)

### Railway S3 Bucket (auto-injected when Bucket is connected, style: "AWS SDK Generic")

> Connect services in Railway dashboard via Variable Reference e.g. ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}

### App-specific (set manually in Railway service Variables tab)

---

## Railway Deployment

> **Always check the Railway docs before doing anything deployment-related — they change frequently.**
> Docs: https://docs.railway.com

### What stays stable (you can rely on this)

**Build**: Railway detects a `Dockerfile` automatically and uses it. No Nixpacks, no Railpack — we always use Dockerfile.

**PORT**: Railway injects a `PORT` env var. Your app must listen on it:

**Health endpoint**: Always implement `/health` returning HTTP 200. Configure it in Railway service settings under Healthcheck. Without it, Railway can't guarantee zero-downtime deploys.

**DATABASE_URL**: Railway Postgres auto-provides this variable. Always use it as-is — never hardcode credentials.

**Internal networking**: Services within the same Railway project communicate via private networking (e.g. `postgres.railway.internal`). Use `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` reference variables in Railway dashboard to wire services together.

**Config as code** (`railway.toml`): For anything beyond defaults, use a `railway.toml` in the project root:

## Known Gotchas

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `routeTree.gen.ts` opens with errors after rename | Mark as readonly in `.vscode/settings.json` |
| `verbatimModuleSyntax` in tsconfig | Remove it — leaks server code into client bundle |
| `app.config.ts` present in project | Delete it — Vinxi-era, replaced by `vite.config.ts` |
| Drizzle imported in a component | Move all DB logic to `src/server/` and call via oRPC |
| better-auth cookies not being set | Add `tanstackStartCookies()` as last plugin in auth config |
| oRPC missing request headers on SSR | Use `createIsomorphicFn` + pass `getHeaders()` server-side |
| Drizzle adapter table name mismatch | Set `usePlural: true` in drizzle adapter if tables use plural names. When `usePlural: true` is set, the explicit schema mapping keys passed to the adapter must also be plural (e.g. `users`, `sessions`, `accounts`) -- not singular. better-auth transforms the canonical model name to plural before lookup, so singular keys will fail with "model not found in schema object". |
| Build output path wrong | TanStack Start with Vite (`vite.config.ts`) outputs to `dist/client/` and `dist/server/` -- NOT `.output/`. The `.output/` path is the old Nitro-era convention and is wrong for the current Vite-based setup. Dockerfile must copy `dist/` and `public/`, not `.output/`. |
| Bun auto-install in container fails | Never copy only `dist/` + `package.json` into runtime stage -- always include a `prod-deps` stage that runs `bun install --production` and copy its `node_modules` into the runtime image. Bun auto-install does not resolve peer dependencies like `kysely` or `better-call` correctly. |
| Railway deploy stuck | No healthcheck configured — add `/api/health` endpoint and set it in service settings |
| Railway port mismatch | App not listening on `process.env.PORT` — Railway injects PORT, always use it |
| DB connection fails on Railway | Use `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` reference variable, not hardcoded URL |

## Dependabot

Every project must have a `.github/dependabot.yml` configured for the full stack. Always create this file when setting up a new project.

Coverage required:
- `npm` ecosystem (covers bun/node_modules) -- weekly, Sunday 08:00 Europe/Berlin
- `docker` ecosystem (Dockerfile base images) -- weekly, Sunday 08:00 Europe/Berlin

Fetch the latest Dependabot config schema before creating the file: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/dependabot-options-reference

## Commit Convention

Always use Conventional Commits. No exceptions.

Format: `type(scope): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `perf`

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add google oauth`
- `fix(db): correct migration for users table`
- `chore(deps): update drizzle-orm to latest`

Keep the description lowercase, imperative, no period at the end.

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Files/folders**: kebab-case (`user-profile.ts`, `auth-client.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Functions/variables**: camelCase (`getUserById`)
- **Database tables**: snake_case plural (`users`, `session_tokens`)
- **Database columns**: snake_case (`created_at`, `user_id`)
- **Environment variables**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`DATABASE_URL`)
- **oRPC procedures**: camelCase nested (`users.getById`, `auth.signIn`)
- **Drizzle schema exports**: camelCase for table objects (`users`, `sessionTokens`)

---

## Error Handling

Use oRPC's built-in `ORPCError` for all API errors -- never throw plain `Error` objects from procedures.

Error codes should be descriptive and uppercase: `UNAUTHORIZED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `FORBIDDEN`.

On the client side, always handle errors explicitly via TanStack Query's `error` state -- never silently swallow errors.

Log errors server-side via oRPC interceptors, not scattered throughout procedures.

---

## Drizzle Migrations

- `drizzle-kit generate` -- generate migration file from schema changes
- `drizzle-kit migrate` -- apply in production and staging
- `drizzle-kit push` -- development only, never production
- Never edit generated migration files manually
- Never delete migration files
- Commit migration files to git
- Always auto-run migrations on deploy via `preDeployCommand` in `railway.toml` -- never rely on manual `railway run bun run db:migrate` after first deploy. Use a dedicated `db:migrate:prod` script that runs the migrator without drizzle-kit (drizzle-kit is a dev dependency and must not be required at runtime).

---

## .env.example

Every project must have a `.env.example` at the root. Whenever a new environment variable is added, update `.env.example` immediately with the key and a placeholder value or short comment. Never commit real secrets.

---

## README

Every project needs a `README.md`. Write it like a talented engineer wrote it -- no AI fluff, no excessive emojis, no "this project leverages cutting-edge technology". Just:
- What the project does (one sentence)
- How to run it locally
- How to deploy it
- Required environment variables (reference `.env.example`)

Short, direct, useful.

---

## Testing

Write tests that Claude Code can execute directly with `bun test`. Use Vitest.

Focus on:
- Server-side logic (oRPC procedures, auth flows, DB queries)
- Critical business logic
- Not UI components

Always run tests after making changes. If tests fail, fix them before moving on.
---

## UI & Copy Rules

### Text / Copy
- NO em-dashes, NO en-dashes, NO dashes of any kind used as a parenthetical or pause. This means never write " — " or "—" anywhere in UI copy.
- If you feel like writing an em-dash, stop. Use a period or rewrite the sentence into two.
  - WRONG: "We never store PR data — everything is live from the API."
  - CORRECT: "We never store PR data. Everything comes live from the GitHub API."
- No AI-sounding phrases ("leverage", "seamlessly", "cutting-edge", "robust", "intuitive", "powerful")
- Short, direct, human. Write like a developer wrote it, not a marketing team.

### Icons
- Always use icons instead of emojis -- use lucide-react as the icon library
- No emojis anywhere in the UI, not even as decoration

### Favicon
- Every app must have a full favicon set. Not just one file.
- Required files: `favicon.svg` (primary), `favicon.ico` (legacy 16/32/48), `favicon-16.png`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180px), `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `manifest.webmanifest`
- SVG is the primary source of truth. Generate all PNGs and ICO from it via a `scripts/generate-icons.ts` script using sharp.
- The SVG design should reflect the app purpose. A plain letter on a colored rounded square is acceptable if done cleanly. No generic placeholders.
- Wire all variants into `__root.tsx` head(): SVG first, then PNG 32/16, ICO shortcut, apple-touch, manifest link.
- The `server.ts` wrapper must serve all favicon/icon/manifest files from `dist/client/` with a 1-day cache header -- they will 404 otherwise.

### Design
- Every UI should feel modern, clean, and slightly elegant -- the kind where someone opens it and says "oh this looks good"
- Use shadcn/ui components as the base, customize from there
- Generous whitespace, consistent spacing, clear visual hierarchy
- Dark mode support by default
- Subtle animations where they add polish, never where they distract
- When in doubt: less is more

---

## Logging

### Startup
Keep startup logs minimal and clean. Only log what matters:
- Server listening on which port
- Database migration result (success or failure, not raw SQL notices)
- Any critical config missing

Never log raw Postgres NOTICE messages (42P07, 42P06, etc.) -- these are not errors. Filter them out by setting the pg connection log level or catching and suppressing NOTICE severity before logging.

### General
- Use structured logging with clear severity levels: info, warn, error
- No stack traces for expected conditions (e.g. migration table already exists)
- Errors must include enough context to debug without being verbose
- Never log sensitive values (tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings)
